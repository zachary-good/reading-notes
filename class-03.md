# Class 3 reading notes

### CH 3
chapter three covers lists in html. there are three types of lists. order, un ordered, and definition lists. ordered lists use numbers when listing items. un ordered lists use bullet points of some sort to list items. the type of number or numeral is something that can be modified. as well as the style of bullet point. both of these things can be edited to your desired styling. definition lists are as they sound used to define terms. finally lists are capable of being nested within each other. when it comes to listing potential, the sky is the limit. 

### CH 13
this chapter covers boxes and how they can be edited with the css styling. boxes are important because as the css styles the page it sees every section of html as a boxed section. with css you can edit every aspect of these text boxes. you can change the sizes, colors, margins and padding of a box. margin is the area outside the box between the edges of the page and the border of hte box. clean margins can make text more readable. the border is the brim of the box and can really set the text apart. padding is the distance between the text and the border of the box, if the padding is done incorrectly the text can run into the border making text very difficult to read. 

### CH 2
the second half of chapter two covers the different values that can be stored in a variable. to include numbers, strings, and bools. the next item is arrays which are basically a mulitple value variable. arrays are capable of storing many values buy of all the same kind. the index of an array is how you determint which item is in which position. arrays are indexed starting at zero and going up from there. expressions and operators are basically mathematical equations that can be used to compare numbers, strings, or bools. they use the standard mathematical operators such as addition subtractoin mulitplication division and is equivalent too. operators are needed to calculate any value and the sum of the whole expressoin always comes out to a single value. 

### CH 4
in this chapter we learn that you can use conditional statements to include the and as well as or. also the is not equal to statement which will show as true if a statement that is made is not equal to the other value. other comparision operators are the less than and greater than values as well as the less than equal too and greater than equal too. second we learned about if, if else, and if if else else statements. these statements allow you to evaluate if a certain criteria is or is not met and then execute a diffrerent piece of code depending on which criteria was met. js can compare non compatable data types in some instances by converting the type to allow for the comparision to be made. this is called being a soft typed language. finally looping and loops are covered. the three types of loops are: for loops, while loops, and do while loops. each loop is slightly different from the others allowing the user to complete different types of task with each. in general loops will continue to exicute until the criteria that is being evaluated in the expression is found to be true or false whichever is being asked. the do while loop will execute a certain block of code as long as the criteria you set is continually met.
