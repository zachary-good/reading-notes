with css we are able to modify the layout of a web page. the key concepts of positioning elements are: building block, containing elements. each html element is treated as if it is in its own block. two types of boxes are block level or inline. block level elements start on a new line, inline blocks flow between text. boxes inside of boxes is known as containing elements. css has several positioning schemes, they are as follows: normal flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning, fixed positioning, and floating elements. the z-index helps you choose which box will overlap the other if you ever find yourself with blocks of code covering each other. different devices have different sizes of screens and it is important to consider the device that the app is intended to be used on. screen resolution is the number of indvidual pixels that a screen has. higher resolution text appears smaller and the inverse is also true. most pages are designed around a 1000px width as this is a common size that will allow most people to be able to view it. historically designers have tried to make all of the pertinent information appear in the top 600px of the page. this was do to a similar idea had in the newspaper press that followed the rule of keeping the best and most eye catching stories "above the fold" on the front page of newspapers. while this idea has changed slightly across time as screens have gotten larger many designers still cling to the top 600px rule. there are two types of layouts: fixed width and fluid. fixed with is set to a certain width by a very specific criteria usually listed in pixels. if a scree is wider there will be blank space and if a screen is not wide enough there will be content hidden from the user that they must scroll to see. liquid layouts are fluid much like actual liquids and adjust to the size of the display seemlessly. both styles have advantages and disadvantages, so consider them carefully to what will best suit your needs.
