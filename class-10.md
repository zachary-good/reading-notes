# Class 10 Reading notes

### Ch 10
this chapter is on error handling and debugging of code. the easiest way to start understanding whats going wrong is to understand how the computer is seeing what you are inputting. its important to see how it is processed so you can see just where you may have gone wrong. its important to understand scope and how it can effect how you should trouble shoot. you problem could be related to the fact that variables you think are reachable are no long so becacuse of the scope of the issue. debugging itself requires critical thinking and the ability to step through a program like a computer would. you must be able to look at the code and see the inconsistancies and the issues in syntax and identify and fix them. in todays age we are fortunate to have a line number and area highlighted as to where the issue originated. these error messages are critical in helping you find the source of the issue and get straight to solving the problem. there are seven diffrent types of errors in js. they are syntaxerror, evalerror, referenceerror, urierror, typeerror, rangeerror, and error. finally it is important to remember the try catch blocks that allow you to try bits of code and catch any errors that my come from it and resolve them if they are known errors that might be thrown expecially in user inputed information from forms or other exceptions that might come from user interface.
