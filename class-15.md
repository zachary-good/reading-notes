### transitions and animations
this article covers how to do transitions and animations in the css. it is mentioned that previously you were required to use js for this same task. things to note: not every property can be transitioned, you can set the transition duration time, you can set the transitions speed, transition delay. animations are used in mulitstage transitions where the traditional transition only works in one stage of change.
