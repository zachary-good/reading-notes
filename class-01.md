# 01 Reading assignment

### Intro 
the intro covers how the book is layed out and how the author is hoping that you will interact with the book. it also goes over the basics of how the internet works and how a user is able to access websites from all over the internet. 

### CH 1
chapter one covers the basics of html and its structure. html pages are just text documents that use tags to create a basic structure to make the viewing of text easier. tags are used to denote how the text is going to be used within the html document. for example if it is paragraph text or heading text, how large of a heading it might be or even what colors the text and background should be. the font, color, language, size and many other things that tags can edit are called attributes. attributes are attached to the opening tag, and require two parts. the two parts of an attribute are the name of said attribute and the value that you set equal to it. tags function in pairs, one tag opens and a second tag closes that section of text. closing tags are created by using the backslash. 

### CH 8
This chapter covers extra markup material for HTML. it begins by covering the how the web browser deciphers between the different versions of html by using the DOCTYPES. The next topic is the HTML comment which is done to leave notes for yourself and others who may be viewing your code. comments look like this: <!-- -->. id tags are tags that you can place in certain elements to reference back too when styling and you want to set a specific sectoin apart. similarly class attributes allow you to set aside specific words to use to modify only a specifc class of tags that you want to change. the division and span tags are used to group together the different types of elements that can not under other circumstances be put together. Meta tags go at the begging of an html page and are used as keywords for the search engine to find what important topics or things might be in your website. and finally escape characters are the specially designated characters that HTML has set aside soley for use with the language. they are basically reserved characters. 

### CH 17
Covers the specifics of HTML5 and how it is different from the other versions of html. one of the new developements is the use of special tags instead of as many DIV tags that were previously used. some of the added tags are article, aside, nav, footer, header. they are used to create division in the page without the use of the DIV tag. older browsers may not be able to identify and render this new code so it is important to include some of the keywords to let the browser know how to treat the code if it is not capable of reading the HTML5. 

### CH 18
this chapter covers how to make sure that your site is best serving those that will be utilizing it. important things to consider when designing a site are who may be visiting, why are they visiting, what are the visitors here for, what are they tring to accomplish and what information do they need to do that, how often will the site get used. when you consider all of these things it will help you have a better idea of what your site needs to look like and how it should be layed out to best accomplish those goals. the plan you come up with is known as a site map and it is the basic design which you will use to render the actual website. its the blue prints for the site. site maps and wireframes are two different types of layout plans that can be used to help you decide on a layout and style. site maps work on the structure of the web page while wire frame helps to layout the individual pages. the easiest way to help a customers experience is to use size, color, and text styles to make what you want to stand out do so. 

### INTRO
the intro covers what it is exactlty that js does and how it is that it does it. it show some examples of how js is used to make the experience better for the end user. 

### CH 1 A
chapter one is broken into three parts. this first section covers the deffinition of a script and what it is. scripts are like problem pathways that you follow to get to a solution. in order to make a nice script you must first have a goal, then figure out which small pieces of the problem you must solve to complete the whole solution. finally you write the actual code to make the whole thing happen. you also have to understand how the computer takes in the information that you give it and how it processes that. 

### CH 1 B
this part of the chapter is about how the computer interprets the data and information that you give it. it uses two main concepts: objects and properties. the computer uses the properties that you assign to describe the objects that you are developing. another way the computer interacts is through events, things like a keystroke or a mouse click. when an outside force acts the computer takes that input and can do a specific action if preprogrammed to do so. the final touch is the method. methods are actions that can happen on an object and they are often utilize the properties of the object as they are changing. 

### CH 1 C
this section covers how to write js. it is recommended that you keep script files seperate from the html file. also the tag to add js to a html is the <> with script written inside. between the open and close script tag you put the js code to make the page really come to life.
