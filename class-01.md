### CH 1
chapter one covers the basics of html and its structure. html pages are just text documents that use tags to create a basic structure to make the viewing of text easier. tags are used to denote how the text is going to be used within the html document. for example if it is paragraph text or heading text, how large of a heading it might be or even what colors the text and background should be. the font, color, language, size and many other things that tags can edit are called attributes. attributes are attached to the opening tag, and require two parts. the two parts of an attribute are the name of said attribute and the value that you set equal to it. tags function in pairs, one tag opens and a second tag closes that section of text. closing tags are created by using the backslash.
