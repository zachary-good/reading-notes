### Ch 3
Functions, objects, and methods. functions let you write a section of code one time but re use it as many times as you need it throughout your code. this saves you a lot of time. functions are written in three parts. the function keyword, the function name, and the code block. in order to call a function you simply type the function name followed by parathesis and a semicolon. functions can have parameters which is a set of information that will be input to the function. there can also be return parameters which is informatoin that gets sent back by the function. local and global variables differ in that local variables are found within a function while global variables are outside of a function and can be used elsewhere in the script.

this article talks about what pair programming is and the many benefits of using pair programming. the pair consists of a navigator and a driver. navigators dont type the actual code they are giving guidance and streamlining productivity. the driver is the one typing the actualy code and managing all of the file and version control. pair programming increases efficiency, code can be written faster and with less errors when four eyes are on it instead of two. its also easy to trouble shoot and find solutions to a problem when two people work on it at one time instead of one. the engagement increases when two programmers work together as compaired to when they work alone. people are able to keep themselves on task more easily with the accountability partner. Learning from each other and teaching each other, a pair programming can expand the knowladge base of both programmers as they will each draw on a different skill set than the other. pair programming can develope better social skills and social interactions in the work place. pair programming also helps to prepare for interviews in the case that the employer wants to see the applicant work in a pair enviroment. 

### Ch 4
this chapter covers links and how they are created and used in an html document. the a tag is used to insert links into html. this is completed by use of the hyperlink referance or href. hrefs are best used for content that is not found within the site you are working on. best practice for links found within a site is to use relative links. relative links end in .html as opposed to a href which is a full http web address. it is important to make sure that you understand the file path/directory structure when creating relative links. a tags are composed of three parts. the tag, the link that youre taken too, and the text that is displayed to the user. email links can also be created, with the mail to:. this allows you to have someones email opened with to address line already filled. the target attribute allows you to open a link in a new tab. you can also link to other areas of the same website page or a specific area of another page on the same site.

### Ch 15
this chapter covers the layout of a page and how the css can modify and change that. position:static is the default and it lays out each block on top of the next. position: relative moves blocks around to where it would be in its default position. with this method you input the offsets that you would like to have when compared to the default location. Position:absolute sets a box in one position and it stays there and has no effect on any of the other boxes. position:fixed fixes the block to a specific location, you would see the block of text scroll up with the page into and out of the screen. z-index allows boxes to sit on top of each other and the one that came earliest in the code will be visible and will block out the code underneath. floating elements are placed to the left or right side of the block and the text flows around it on the opposite side. float requires a defined width. other items to consider when desigin are: screen sizes, screen resolution, page sizes, and if it is a fixed width or liquid layout. (normal flow, relative, absolute, fixed positioning). keep pages within 960-1000 pixels and show what site is within top 600 pixels.
