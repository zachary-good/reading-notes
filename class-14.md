# Class 14 reading notes

### Google article
this article covers a study done by google as well as many other entities across the span of time trying to figure out how to optimzie human performance and to make the most efficeint working teams. basically after all of googles studies were conducted the biggest thing is people need to be able to be open and honest with each other and let each other know if and when theyre dealing with something. having open lines of communication and being comfortable with the team you are in allows the team to mess better and get more accomplished because they are able to be who they really are away from work while they are at work. I think the single biggest statement in the article that stood out to me was when they talked about everyone hates putting on their work face in the morning and acting that certain way at work. coming from the military I can total attest to that, every single person I knew through work acted and was always a certain way....at work. there were a few exceptions but even those exceptions when seen outside of the work settin were completely different people. and it blew my mind. people who I only knew has hardened and fearce were fathers, husbands, and even friends to others outside of work. I think its a shame that they couldnt be comfortable with who they were outside of work while at work, and its something I dont intend to do myself ever again. I will really be looking into the culture and working enviroment of the companies and teams I apply for in the future.
