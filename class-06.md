# Class 06 Reading Notes

### understanding the problem domain
this article covers understanding the problem domain and the importance of that. I could not agree more! it has been my position to usually go through the whole problem and hash out all of the logic that I am going to be using for code on paper before I even turn on my computer. this way I know that what I am trying to achieve is possible and should work so that when I go to the computer I can simply focus on the computer based issues that I develope such as syntax errors and other computer specific issues that would require me to adapt my initial logic. I think its important to keep sight of what the problem is and revisit that often. this is particularly important when you get stalled or stuck and are not sure that what youre working at is correct or going to have the desired effect. 

### Chapter 3
this chapter covers functions, methods, and objects and how they can all work together. specifically objects in this half of the chapter. objects can be created one by one or you could creat a function to make the process easier. you use the new keyword to creat new instances of an object. objects can have methods that are basically like functions and execute specific code when called. objects use dot notation which is the way that you access the variables of the object. this is a specific keyword that is used to describe which ever element you are currently in. it basically lets you make a function genearic so that you can plug in whatever name you want for that specific object and be describing it without putting in each individual part.  there are three built in groups of objects in js, browser object, document object, and global javascript objects. the most notable of these built in object that we use are the string, math, number, and date objects. 

### chapter 5
document object model or dom. a dom tree is one visual represention of the breakdown. a node list is a collection of nodes. caching a selection is saving a shortcut for the browser to be able to find the same item again. live nodelist will update the script right away where as a static node list will not update the script automatically when the page is updated. you can select node elements in several different ways: class attributes, tag name, css selectors. to traverse through the dom you use these commands: parentNode(take you back to the parent node), previous/nextSibling(takes you to nodes in the same list to the left or right), and first/lastChild(takes you to the first or last elements below a parent element). there are also whitespace nodes which pose several problems do developers but languages like jquery help to easy and solve those issues.
