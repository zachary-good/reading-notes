### Local storage article. 
this article covers the history of local storage and the use of local storage within html5. its very interesting to see how hacks were used to make some type of local storage before it was officially availiable. I also find it very interesting the authors perspective on cookies and how useful he seems to think they are. after covering a brief history of storage hacks the author goes into a bit mroe techincal detail as to how we check and interface with local storage in the browser. one limitation of local storage is that it stores all data as a string so its possible to have too much data for the 5mb brick. as the author looks to the future(I assume modern technology as this article seems to be older) he is excited about the webDB which appears to be some a type of sql database integrated with the interwebs. it looks like indexDB was the hottest of hotnesses when this article came to a wrap, looks like we will find out what the new standards are tomorrow!
