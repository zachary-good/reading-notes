### CH 2
this chapter is covering basic syntax of js. starting with statements comments and variables, the basic building blocks of scripting. how to declare and assign a value to variable is the next step in understanding how to write code. you must first declare a variable, that is to give it a name. after it is in existance it can then get a value assigned to it. how to store each different data type in a variable is a very important thing. strings, numbers, and boolean are three types of variables that you might need to store for a variable. to store mulitple values in a variable you can use an array that is basically a list of values all under one variable. js uses all of the basic mathematical operators you would use in a math class or any other programming language. when you use operators in an expression the end result will be a single value that can then be passed along to the desired location or output to the user.

the computer can make a decision by comparing the information it has and deciding if a criteria has or has not been met. you can use these techniques to help guide the computer to what it should do next, this can be done through a series of questions and answers that are flowed through one step at a time. the comparison between the provided value and the value that may have been input by the user can be accomplished by basic mathematical logic. is the item equal too or not equal to the comparison? is it greater than or less than the comparisson? a logical operation is one that combines the previously mentioned check with some logic like and or or. if both this criteria and the other one is met then its good. if this one ort that one meets the criteria you are good to go. this adds a bit of diversity and changes the type of questions that you can answer. finally the if else statement allows you to compare something to see if a certain outcome is desired and if that outcome is not reached the alternative outcome executes. this is a great way to hav ea default outcome that will happen if a specific criteria is not met in the if statement. 

## CH 2
this chapter covers the text that makes up the document and how you can edit and change it to make its appearance nicer for the end user. you are able to set certain parts of the text apart by using headings of various sizes to really make imporant titles stand out from the body of the text. you can set apart paragraphs in the text by using the p tag to creat breaks and set up different block of text. you can manipulate the font style and size of font to make certain text stand out from other lines of text. you can maninpulate the way that the spacing between lines and sections is set up to create more emphasis. everything in the text is almost editable which allows you to really create an easy on the eyes experience for the end user. 

## CH 10
css allows you to style the text more closely to how you want it to look. this allows you to get every detail right. there is internal and external css. internal css modifies the text within you document and you can change the color size font and many other aspects of the text within the html page. external css allows you to bring in link and other content from outside of you html page. maps and pictures are two suche example of content from an external source. css allows you to not only bring those things into your page but also decide how they will be presented on the final web page. selectors allow a way to edit and change specific sections of text only. with selectors you can edit a section of the text from the entire document down to just a few letters or words in a single line of text. it is called cascading style sheet because you can apply mulitple attributes or rules to a single section of text. the interesting thing is that the rules have an order of operations that they casade or flow down through. this is why it is called cascading style sheet. also just like many other languages out there you save time by using inheritance for the sheet. this is when you set up the inital class and all subsiquent classes get the same setting pre set from you initial class. an amazing time savings.
